# Personal Portfolio

Repository for the source code of my personal portfolio, designed to showcase my professional background, technical skills, projects, and experience as a Software Engineer with a focus on backend development.

The portfolio is hosted using a custom domain provided by **[is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev/)**, an open-source project that offers free subdomains for developers.
